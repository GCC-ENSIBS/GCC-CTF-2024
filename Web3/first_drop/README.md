# GCC | First drop | Web3 MEDIUM

After many months of preparation, Beyond, the greatest art company has finally launched their NFT.

People can buy them for **1 ETH** and even get a refund if they are not satisfied.

For their first drop, they are collaborating with an independant artist called **Above** who launched a special collection just for the event.

Only the first 5 owners of a Beyond NFT are eligible to get their hands on it.

There is no way you can get your hands on **more than 5 Above NFTs** right ?
