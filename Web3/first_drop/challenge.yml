  After many months of preparation, Beyond, the greatest art company has finally launched their NFT.

  People can buy them for 1 ETH and even get a refund if they are not satisfied.

  For their first drop, they are collaborating with an independant artist called Above who launched a special collection just for the event.

  Only the first 5 owners of a Beyond NFT are eligible to get their hands on it.
