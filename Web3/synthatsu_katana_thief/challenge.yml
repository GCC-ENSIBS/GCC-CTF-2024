  2000 years from now, the earth has seen many wars, and the surface of the earth was forever damaged.
  
  Humans had to develop floating cities, the first one was Synthatsu, made by what was left of the Japanese history.
  
  Mixing futuristic building with a hint of traditional looks.
  
  This town was well known for its close combat weapons.
  
  One of the most prized katana maker works in that town.
  
  But just yesterday, some thugs named Beyond robbed his shop, and took some of his work!
