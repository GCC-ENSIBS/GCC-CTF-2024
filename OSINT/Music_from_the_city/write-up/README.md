## Sound page?

Soundcloud or Bandcamp (or mayber specific websites for music from cities)

Let's start with the classic Soundcloud:
- search "jean vannes" or modify the search url https://soundcloud.com/search/people?q=jean&filter.place=vannes
- get 8 accounts
- https://soundcloud.com/jean_the_crepe_enjoyer

*Welp* sometimes you can't make the best challenges. Sometimes the search engine is just too powerful :/


> [!NOTE]
> Many "OSINT-ed" a real student in our school. Don't look too deep especially when it's an Intro level chall.
> 
> Also, many looked for the song. You have no intel about the song other than it exists and came out. Don't look for ghost.
